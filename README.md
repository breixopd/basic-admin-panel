# basic-admin-panel
A fairly basic admin panel which allows you to run shell commands, see server resources, write and save notes (displayed as cards) and more. Also saves log in attempts with IP, date and the email attempted and displays inside the dashboard.

## Set up
Import `db.sql` to your MySQL server
Edit database credentials in `server.php` line 10

## Compatibility
Constantly updating but currently mainly tested on Ubuntu servers with most features also having Windows compatibilities (as Windows has different permissions and commands)
